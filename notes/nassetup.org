#+title: Proxmox, TrueNAS, VM and Container Setup

* Bios
- Enable SVM (amd) or VT-d (intel) 
- Sata mode to AHCI not RAID
- Enable XMP if supported

* Proxmox
** Installation
- Select installation drive ((nvme-)ssd)
- Choose locale
- Set password and email (login will be 'root')
- Set up networking
  - Pick a hostname: 'proxmox.<domain.com>'
  - My preference: x.x.x.1 = default gateway and dns, x.x.x.2 = proxmox, x.x.x.3 = truenas
- Installation
- Disable enterprise repository in proxmox repositories
- Add no-subscription repository
- Iommo setup:
  - Via the proxmox shell edit /etc/default/grub
    - Add or edit: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet amd_iommu=on"
    - ~update-grub~
  - Edit /etc/modules
    - add on seperate lines: vfio vfio_iommu_type1 vfio_pci vfio_virqfd
  - Reboot
- Pve Shell: ~pveam update~ to get turnkey templates if they are not available
- (optional) ACMA (traefik will always grand a certificate, just required for novnc on proxmox mobile (vpn and local dns needed (pihole & wireshark in boileplates))):
  - Datacenter - ACMA:
  - Accounts: Add staging account with admin@domain email and give it a name. Add a normal lets encrypt account with same info.
  - Challenge: cloudflare, Cloudflare Managed DNS.
    - CF Account ID can be found on the overview page of the website.
    - API token can be found under this id.
      - Create a token: Edit zone DNS
        - Change token name to proxmox
        - Permission:
          - zone dns edit
          - zone zone read
        - Sone Resources:
          - include specific zone <domain.com>
        - Create
  - Proxmox server: System - Certificates
    - Add DNS - cloudflare - pve.<domain.com> - Create
    - Using Account: Staging - Order Certificates Now
    - If the reloaded webUI uses the staging certificates, it can be changed to official letsencypt account and order certificates again.
    - (if there are any issues, you might need to add an A record for pve to your public ip with dns only and a TTL ~2min)
  - In pihole: Add a local dns entry for pve.<domain.com> to the ip of proxmox
    - Via mobile you can not connect to pve.domain.com:8006
    - You should normally be still able to add the same domain to traefik and the local dns will not interfere if you don't add the port
** TrueNAS Setup
- Drop down proxmox datacenter
- Select the local storage and upload ISO Image
- Create VM
  - General: Give it a name
  - General: Start at boot, order 1
  - OS: Select uploaded ISO
  - System: Enable Qemu Agent
  - Disks: Enable SSD emulation if storage is an SSD
  - CPU: Atleast 2 core
  - Memory: 8GB RAM + 1GB per TB
  - Memory: Disable Ballooning Device
- Passthrough
  - Proxmox disks: Initialize disk with gpt (I think only needed if you passthrough only the disk)
  - Passthrough with hba sas card or mobo sata controller- VM: Hardware - Add - PCIE
    - For me SATA1,2,3 = 08:00.0
      - ~lspci~
      - You can check to which sata controller drive is connected with ~udevadm info -q path -n /dev/<sd...>~
  - Passthrough seperately
    - From proxmox shell:
      - ~ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/~
      - ~qm set <vm id> -scsi<1,2,3,...> /dev/disk/by-id/<full serial-model-number>~
      - repeat

    - smb/cifs (network drives)

** Notes:
- Wireguard: run ~sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1~ in node and container to actually get things working.
- Root ssh login: edit ~/etc/ssh/sshd_config~ and add "PermitRootLogin yes". Ofcourse don't forget to ~systemctl restart ssdh.service~

**** Proxmox
Add network share created for proxmox as extra storage in proxmox

*** Media
proxmox:
- use debian iso
- ID = 101
- boot order = 2 (1 if not on truenas pool)
- CPU = 4 cores
- RAM = 4GB (no ballooning)
- Storage = 64GB stored on local-lvm. Used to store these on the truenas dataset. When doing this enable native instead of io_uring (this can be buggy)
- Enable QEMU Guest Agent (or work wit acpid (below))
vm:
- ~apt install sudo && vim /etc/sudoers~: add user to sudoers
- ~apt install qemu-guest-agent && systemctl start qemu-guest-agent && reboot~
  - Some ram/timeout fixes:
    - ~sysctl -w vm.dirty_ratio=10 && sysctl -w vm.dirty_background_ratio=5 && sysctl -p~
- ~apt install acpid && systemctl enable/start acpid.service~: makes it easier to gracefully shut down vm. I guess it's not really an issue to use both acpid and qemu-guest-agent
- Install docker engine
- Set static ip
  - ~sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces~:
    - swap ~allow-hotplug <nic> \ iface <nic> inet dhcp~ to ~auto <nic> \ iface <nic> inet static \ address <static> \ netmask 255.255.255.0 \ gateway 192.168.0.1~
  - ~sudo systemctl restart networking.service~
- Connect media smb:
  - ~sudo apt install cifs-utils~
  - ~sudo vim /etc/fstab~
  - ~sudo mkdir -p /mnt/media /mnt/photo/family~: used to mount share
  - Add
    - ~//192.168.0.3/media /mnt/media cifs username=<smblogin>,password=<smblogin>,uid=1000,gid=1000,_netdev,nofail 0 0~
    - ~//192.168.0.3/media /mnt/photo/family cifs username=<smblogin>,password=<smblogin>,uid=1000,gid=1000,_netdev,nofail 0 0~
- Setup the portainer agent: ~docker run -d -p 9001:9001 --name portainer_agent --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /var/lib/docker/volumes:/var/lib/docker/volumes portainer/agent:latest~
  - So it can be accessed by portainer running on the network container. (more info on connection in boilerplates)
- File setup for services
  - ~sudo mkdir /home/<user>/Downloads~
  - ~sudo mkdir /home/<user>/Docker /home/<user>/Docker/{deluge,prowlarr,radarr,sonarr,bazarr,plex}~
- Setup torrent, prowlarr, radarr, sonarr, bazarr in portainer (using the boilerplates)

*** Windows
- Windows 11 iso from official website
- Virtio drivers: https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows_VirtIO_Drivers (I believe they are hosted by Fedora)
- ID = 300
- CPU = 4 cores
- CPU type = host (when moved to other host, might need to change)
- RAM = 8GB (ballooning on)
- Guest OS = Type MS Windows 11/2022
- System = q35
- BIOS = OVMF
- Add TPM
- Network model = VirtIO
- Enable Qemu Agent
- Disk Device = VirtIO Block
- After creation:
  - Add hardware: CD/DVD Drive with virtio iso
**** Notes
- On first boot, quickly press enter to correctly boot.
- During installation load the correct drivers from virtio iso:
  - amd64/win11
  - netkvm/win11
- In windows, in file explorer, open virtio iso
  - Install all drivers using the virtio-win-gt-x64 installer and reboot
  - It's also recommended to install the virtio-win-guest-tools (this will fix the mouse stutter when using spice)
- After installation, press esc during boot to change resolution to prefered resolution
  - This can be buggy and you might need to reboot multiple times
- If the vm gets stuck or can't reboot or shut down, in the pve shell run:
  - ~ps aux | grep 300~
  - ~kill -9 <id given>~

*** MacOS
- MacOS monterey iso from https://techrechard.com/
- OpenCore iso from guide link below
- ID = 300
- CPU = 4 cores
- CPU type = Penryn
- RAM = 8GB (ballooning on)
- Guest OS = Other
- System = q35
- Graphic card = VMware compatible
- Hard Drive iso = OpenCore
- BIOS = OVMF
- Pre-Enrolled Keys unchecked
- Network model = VirtIO
- Disk Device = VirtIO Block
- Cache = Write back (unsafe)
- Network Model: VirtIO or VMware vmxnet3
- After creation:
  - Add hardware: CD/DVD Drive with MacOS monterey iso
**** Notes
- Follow this guide: https://i12bretro.github.io/tutorials/0628.html

*** Running with spice
- Makes sound possible
- Add/Change hardware:
  - Audio Device: ich9-intel-hda
  - Display: SPICE (qxl,memory=128)
- Mouse stutter? - install virtio-win-guest-tools in the virtio iso.
- When launching with console, it will download a virt-viewer file.
  - If disto allows it, just double-click and it will open de vm.
  - Otherwise ~remote-viewer <path/to/file>~

** Container
*** Network
proxmox:
- container template of debian 11
- ID = 200
- Boot order = 1
- CPU = 1 core
- RAM = 1GB (no ballooning)
- SWAP = 1GB
- Storage = 8GB stored on local-lvm
- Firewall = Disabled
- IP = 192.168.0.4
- In proxmox and container shell ~sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1~
container:
- Install docker engine: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/
- Get portainer: ~docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest~
  - Inside portainer create a stack for wireguard and pihole (also don't for get to create the needed dirs to store data). Setups can be found in boilerplates.

*** Cloud
proxmox:
- container template of debian 11
- ID = 201
- Boot order = 1
- CPU = 1 core
- RAM = 1GB (no ballooning)
- SWAP = 1GB
- Storage = 8GB stored on local-lvm
- Firewall = Enabled
- IP = 192.168.0.11
- Unprivileged container = No (need to mount cifs)
- Features
  - nesting = enables (makes everything faster in privileged container)
  - mount = cifs
container:
- Install docker engine: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/
- Get portainer: ~docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest~
  - Inside portainer create a stack for nextcloud (+mariadb) and collabora (also don't for get to create the needed dirs to store data). Setups can be found in boilerplates.
- From personal experience it's better to use the official docker setup (from boilerplates) because it's easier to set it up with mariadb (which is a bit more performant then SQlite)
  - The only issue is that external SMB is not enables but this can still be done using fstab and adding a local directory pass through to docker.
- Edit ~/etc/fstab~ and add ~//192.168.0.3/storage /mnt/storage cifs username=<smblogin>,password=<smblogin>,uid=33,gid=33,_netdev,nofail 0 0~ (uid/gid 33 is used because this is the www-data docker group)

- Nextcloud:
  - It's recommended to set up https with Traefik beforehand. This makes the setup a bit easier and automated.
    - If this is not done and you can't log in after registration, use chromium or firefox private window.
    - If planning to use an editor, add a middleware for onlyoffice: ~middlewares: onlyoffice-headers: headers: customrequestheaders: X-Forwarded-Proto: "https"~ (will fix white infinite loading screen)
  - Editors:
    - Onlyoffice
      - Setup a stack from the boilerplates
      - Nextcloud apps: install onlyoffice
      - Nextcloud settings: add url of onlyoffice documentserver
    - Collabora
      - Setup a stack form the boilerplates
      - Nextcloud apps: install nextcloud office (or sometimes named collabora office)
      - Nextcloud settings: add url of collabora
        - There might be change this gives an error with mismatching http and https but should be fine. In worse case reload page.
    - There can be some issues with using these. See the paragraph about editing the files below.
      - This encountering issues with not being able to access the files, redis might be a solution. Also check that the smb is mounted as the correct id.
      - With doubt, just remove everthing and build fresh (don't even try recreate...)
  - Apps:
    - Enable external storage support
    - Install nextcloud office
  - Settings:
    - Administration:
      - External storage: Add local storage linked to ~/data~ (since this is how it's used in the boilerplate)
  - Edit docker files: ~/html/config/config.php~ between ~$CONFIG = array ( ... );~:
    - Add trusted domains if everything was set-up before setting up tls and a domain url
      - ~'trusted_domains' => array ( 0 => 'subdomain nextcloud.domain', 1 => 'subdomain openoffice/collabora.domain' ),~
    - Allow connections from mobile phone app:
      - ~'overwriteprotocol' => 'https',~
